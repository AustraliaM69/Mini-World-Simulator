A simple 2D world simulation where characters live, eat, and interact with each other.

## What it does

Characters wander around a procedurally generated world made of grass, trees, water, and mountains. They get hungry and seek out food, get lonely and look for other characters to socialize with, and just generally try to survive.

The simulation runs in real-time with a simple UI - you can click on characters to see their thoughts and memories, and watch as they build relationships with each other over time.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Java installed
2. Compile: `javac -cp . WorldSimApp.java`
3. Run: `java WorldSimApp`

## Controls

- **Speed Up**: Makes the simulation run faster
- **Pause**: Stops the simulation
- **Reset**: Resets the simulation speed
- **Click on characters**: See their thoughts and stats
- **Click on animals**: See their info

Pretty basic stuff, but it's fun to watch the little guys go about their day!
